crossorigin.me
==============

A CORS proxy replacement. Based partly on https://github.com/bmpvieira/simple-corsproxy.

## What?
crossorigin.me is a CORS proxy. It lets developers (like you!) access resources from other sites that don't have CORS enabled on their server.

## Why?
One of the more well known CORS proxies, corsproxy.com, recently disappeared. Quite a few things relied on that site, so I decided to set a new proxy up. 

## Where?

[Here](http://crossorigin.me).
